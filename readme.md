Sure! I can help you write a detailed README for your Flask-based ML project. A well-structured README includes:

1. **Project Title**
2. **Description**
3. **Installation Instructions**
4. **Project Structure**
5. **How to Run**
6. **Technologies Used**
7. **Dataset**
8. **ML Model Details**
9. **Usage**
10. **Screenshots**
11. **License**
12. **Contributors**

If you want me to tailor it further with specific parts of your code, share key sections like:

- Routes in Flask
- Front-end (HTML/JS/CSS) structure
- ML model details (like model architecture, libraries used, or any trained model file)

Otherwise, here’s a starting point for your README:

# Diabetic Retinopathy Stage Detection

A machine learning project that determines the **stage of diabetic retinopathy** a person is at, using an interactive web interface. Built with **Flask** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend.

## Description

This project detects the **stage of diabetic retinopathy** using a machine learning model. Users can upload retinal images, and the system predicts one of the following stages:

- No Diabetic Retinopathy (Stage 0)
- Mild Stage
- Moderate Stage
- Severe Stage
- Proliferative Stage

The Flask backend serves the model and handles the user interface requests.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend:

- Flask (Python web framework)
- Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

### Frontend:

- HTML/CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript for interactivity and API calls

---

## Dataset

The model was trained using the **[APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)**. The dataset contains thousands of retinal images labeled into 5 classes (stages of retinopathy).

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the pre-trained ML model file (e.g., `model.h5`) in the project directory.

## How to Run

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. Upload an image of the retina to get predictions.

---

## Usage

1. **Open the Web Interface**  
   Access the application on your local server.

2. **Upload Image**  
   Use the upload button to provide a retinal image.

3. **View Prediction**  
   The system will predict and display the stage of diabetic retinopathy.

---

## Model Details

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Input**: Preprocessed retinal images
- **Output**: Classification into 5 stages
